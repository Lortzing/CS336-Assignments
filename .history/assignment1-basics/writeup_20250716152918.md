## Problem (unicode1): Understanding Unicode (1 point)
### (a) What Unicode character does chr(0) return?
Answer: chr(0) returns the NULL character.
### (b) How does this characterâ€™s string representation (__repr__()) differ from its printed representation?
Answer: The __repr__() of chr(0) shows '\\x00', but printing it produces an invisible, non-printable character.
### (c) What happens when this character occurs in text? It may be helpful to play around with the
following in your Python interpreter and see if it matches your expectations:
>>> chr(0)
>>> print(chr(0))
>>> "this is a test" + chr(0) + "string"
>>> print("this is a test" + chr(0) + "string")
Deliverable: A one-sentence response.
